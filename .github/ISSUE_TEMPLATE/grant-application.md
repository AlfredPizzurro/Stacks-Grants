**Background**
Upon completion of all three phases of DiviUp buildout the DiviUp ecosystem will be an interactive blockchain platform, App and DApp, for digital content creators to collaborate, create, store, track, share and monetize their digital content on an open-source decentralized user-owned token platform network. We are ready to build the DiviUp platform that will be funded, owned, and governed by the users. That is, we will flip the script placing the ownership and governance back in the hands of the creators where it belongs. DiviUpâ€™s token will create a global business structure that will live on throughout future generations supported by multiple revenue streams that are linked to new copyrights creating a perpetual revenue stream for Clarity smart contracts.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40580076/115312773-d0de7080-a126-11eb-8a35-0fa5253b47ab.png)

**What problems do you aim to solve** While there are 1 billion content creators only 2% of them earn a living on social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. The distribution of content is highly controlled by social media platforms and the media industry, giving producers, content creators and creatives very few options to collaborate, create and monetize their digital content. These platforms lack the ability to track and monetize each element of a digital content chain. We plan to give creators and their fans the ability to collaborate, track, store, vote, share, and monetize their content as well as own and govern a stake in the decentralized storage and distribution network. This is the initial stage in creating the network effect and requiring members to have a Stacks ID, agree to link storage to Gaia, agree to become Stackers, and agree to sign up for a DiviUp Wallet. Our mission is to accelerate the transition to a user-owned digital ecosystem that creates and distributes value to its members worldwide.

**How does it serve the mission of a user owned internet** We plan to give creators and their fans the ability to collaborate, track, store, vote, share, and monetize their content as well as own and govern a stake in the decentralized storage and distribution network. This is the initial stage in creating the network effect and requiring members to have a Stacks ID, agree to link storage to Gaia, agree to become Stackers, and agree to sign up for a DiviUp Wallet.

**Project Overview**
The initial phase will involve building a DiviUpTV App Channel on Roku which will be the initial minimal viable product used to generate revenue that will create transaction fees for Clarity smart contracts to pay content creators/owner. The DiviUpTV App Channel will also provide an advertising medium that will drive fans and creators to participate in contests that will require them to become a DiviUp member, create a Stacks ID, sign up for a DiviUp Wallet, sign up for the DiviUp Stacker program and agree to link their storage to Gaia. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40580076/115313661-8a8a1100-a128-11eb-8a72-9414d32e0466.png)

**Who will it serve** Content creators (YouTube (YT) channel owners with 100K to 1M+ Subscribers (Subs)) will earn tenfold the CPM rate they receive on paid search by means of an OTT linear television (Roku) advertising model with an inline Ad CPM. We incentivize the Fans (Subs) as the workforce using a reward contests and DiviCoins as fuel to deliver 50K content creator VOD channels and 120 million members. We increase the reach and pay rate of the YT channel owners by introducing them to another large video platform. This delivers the network effect and initial revenue stream to create Clarity smart contracts and drive members to create a Stacks ID, sign up for a DiviUp Wallet, sign up for the DiviUp Stacker program and agree to link their storage to Gaia. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40580076/115313884-f1a7c580-a128-11eb-9447-216e2bb4e9c1.png)
